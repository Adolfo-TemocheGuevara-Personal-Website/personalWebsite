repo for personal website


##Update
### The website is now more responsive(flex) as well as it now has a a contact page (contact.html), where a person is able to submit their name, email and message and I will recieve it through fromspree. Added @media selectors and added more comments. Also in my orginal project board a partner has now joined my organization and added some tasks to complete.

First need to create repo in github so that it links to VS code so that you can start all of these files in that repo. Make as many branches as needed for changes
and commits with a good description. Also when that repo is created a very detailed #Readme needs to be written explaining what is going on in this whole repo.
This is for a personal website project that has 5 files in all. An index.html, about.html, portfolio.html, style.css and javascript.js .
In the index.html file it is basically the home page that should interest the user into exploring the rest of the pages. It also starts off the header
with the name of the person's website as well as the links to the other pages. From there in the 2nd link it is the about.html which focuses on what the person 
is about, hobbies or other interesting things about the creator of the website. The portfolio.html file is about the page that shows off the examples of projects
that the creator of the website did. In this case fake projects that have not actually been created. All pages should be syntaxed and commented properly to let 
any other person read the code easily. In the style.css file all creative and artistic ways to show all the content in the page will be put in here. Colors, background images, spacing out the info in a beautiful way will be here. Finally in the javascript.js file it should only have a line that would correctly output Hello World .
