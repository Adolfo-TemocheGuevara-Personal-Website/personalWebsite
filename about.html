        <p>I love to make sure that they are ok healthwise and that they are eating well.</p>
        <p>Going outside and to walk/run with them is also another benefit of exercise for all.</p>
        <p>Defintely brings the mood up in the house when they are around.</p>

        <p>I have always been a big fan of technology even as a kid with computers and videogames. Now with programming and becoming a developer.</p>
        <p>It fascinates me how one can create things in a computer programs that are the instuctions and guidelines in every app that we use.</p>
        <p>Self driving cars, robots, and AI are a few things that we have come so far in world and they all interest me. Everything in this field I find compelling.</p>
        <p>I also like to play videogames, immerse myself but also have fun with friends and decompress.</p>

        <p>Though I tend to fall off and pick it up I like to workout and exercise.</p>
        <p>Whether its running or walking with my dogs.</p>
        <p>Lifting weights and doing strength exercises.</p>
        <p>Or even jumping rope, everything makes me feel better and have more energy throughout the day.</p>
