        <p>I love to make sure that they are ok healthwise and that they are eating well.</p>
        <p>Going outside and to walk/run with them is also another benefit of exercise for all.</p>
        <p>Defintely brings the mood up in the house when they are around.</p>

        <p>Though I honestly don't have the time like I used I still like to game every now and again.</p>
        <p>Playing a singleplayer game that just immerses me in that world or playing with friends.</p>
        <p>It makes me have some fun, chill and relives stress.</p>

        <p>Though I tend to fall off and pick it up I like to workout and exercise.</p>
        <p>Whether its running or walking with my dogs.</p>
        <p>Lifting weights and doing strength exercises.</p>
        <p>Or even jumping rope, everything makes me feel better and have more energy throughout the day.</p>
